# CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier
Building a neural network to classify 43 different types of road sign in Pytorch.

## Description

The objective of the project is to classify road signs. The project came from Udacity and was initially done in tensorflow. I have used Pytorch in this revisited version. The project uses a dataset of 34,800 images covering 43 different types of road sign. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip).



## Loading the dataset

The zip archive contains 3 pickle files with training, validation and test RGB images, all 32x32 pixels. The zip file also contains a CSV file (signnames.csv) with the first column containing the class ID (an integer spanning 0-42), and the second column containing a descriptive name of the sign. Here are the first 4 rows:

ClassId	SignName
0	Speed limit (20km/h)
1	Speed limit (30km/h)
2	Speed limit (50km/h)
3	Speed limit (60km/h)


## Data augmentation

The provided train dataset is highly unbalanced between classes. A few classes have large number of samples when many others have a limited amount only. This is a proven for the training phase and data augmentation is necessary to rebalance the data representation.

Data augmentation is performed in several steps towards achieving a minimum number of samples in under-represented classes. This threshold is set at 1000 images or 1500 images.
A threshold of 1000 images minimum per class results into 16,891 new images from the data augmentation steps bringing the dataset from 34,800 up to 51,700 images (+50%).

Data augmentation is performed using : 
- symetry invariance : several road sign types are invariant to horizontal flip ('No entry'), or vertical flip ('No vehicules', 'No entry') or rotation ('roundabout mandatory').
- symetry transpose : a few signs transpose to another using horizontal symetry ('Dangerous curve to the left' --> 'Dangerous curve to the right')
- combination of small rotation (max 15Â°), horizont/vertical shift (max 3 pixels) and image crop (max 2 pixels on each sides).

The resulting dataset is much more balanced which will faciliate the training process.
